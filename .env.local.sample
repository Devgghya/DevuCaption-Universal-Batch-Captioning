## Sample environment file
# Do NOT put your real API key in the repository. Create a local `.env.local`
# file (ignored by git) if you need an environment variable during local
# development. Prefer entering your API key in the application UI instead.
# Example:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=

# Leave blank here to ensure no key is committed.
